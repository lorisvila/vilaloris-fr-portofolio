      "TITLE": "S.DOT network equipment configuration bench",
      "VERSION": "v0",
      "CONTEXT": "End-of-studies project for the BTS in Systems Maintenance at the Bischheim Industrial Technicentre",
      "PROBLEM": "New network equipment is installed in TER trains during their mid-life renovation operations (OPTER Operation), however the configuration is complicated due to their dispersion in hard-to-access areas of the train",
      "SOLUTION": "Creation of a bench in the form of an IT rack that can accommodate all network equipment of a trainset, enabling configuration in a single masked-time operation",
      "GAINS": "Reduction of task time from 2 agents over 2 shifts with train immobilization, to 1 agent for 1 shift in masked time",
